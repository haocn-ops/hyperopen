  "Intervention-horizon inference from the user's own fills.

  Fills are reconstructed into position episodes per coin (an episode starts
  when net exposure leaves zero and ends at zero or on a direction flip).
  Risk-reducing fills, closes, and flips are interventions; the gaps between
  consecutive interventions (episode start included) form the sample. The
  horizon is an upper quantile of those gaps — how long this user plausibly
  leaves a position unattended — not their average trade frequency.")

  Consecutive fills are merged when they share an order id (or, lacking ids,
  the same coin and direction within `coalesce-window-ms`). The merged fill
