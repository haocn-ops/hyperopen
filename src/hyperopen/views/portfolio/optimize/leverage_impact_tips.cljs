  tip copy, split from leverage-impact-panel when the current-book tile

  Honesty contract carried by this copy (see leverage-impact-panel): the
  model is a closed-form lognormal — not a simulation, with no funding /
  execution / liquidation modeling — so the copy must never claim simulated
  paths, cash costs, or a liquidation probability the model does not
  compute."
