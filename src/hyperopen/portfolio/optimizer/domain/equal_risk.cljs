  "Constrained Equal Risk (:equal-risk) core policy: the centralized numeric
  tolerances, exposure targets, book split, deterministic initializer seeds,
  quality classification, and the damped-BFGS model-Hessian updates.

  The user has already fixed every directional decision (assets, sides, gross
  target G). Equal Risk ignores stored net policy and only sizes positions
  inside one signed-gross equality:

      long book  = assets whose encoded bounds keep w_i >= 0
      short book = assets whose encoded bounds keep w_i <= 0
      G = sum(long weights) + sum(abs(short weights))

  Gross targets come from the canonical exposure-policy midpoint semantics via
  the :exposure-targets the constraint encoder carries; long-only requests use
  that gross target when present and otherwise keep the legacy fully-invested
  fallback.

  Companions: contribution math and gradients in domain.risk-contributions,
  presolve feasibility in domain.equal-risk-presolve, the solver plan and QP
  subproblem shapes in domain.equal-risk-plan, and the iterative
  orchestration in application.engine.equal-risk-solve."

                         within this fraction OF the 1/n target share, so the
