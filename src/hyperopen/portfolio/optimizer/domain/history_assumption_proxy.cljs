  "Pure proxy-basket covariance synthesis for engine-backed proxy history
  assumptions.

  Modeling contract (see the 2026-07-05 proxy-history-assumptions ExecPlan):
  the qualitative prior (the user's selected proxy basket) chooses the exposure;
  a multi-proxy ridge regression on the asset's short overlap adjusts it; a
  confidence weight built from sample count and fit quality governs the
  shrinkage between the two; specific (idiosyncratic) risk and the cap keep the
  optimizer honest. R-squared is a confidence signal only - NEVER a source of
  proxy weights - and a handful of observations must never dominate the prior.

  Everything here is deterministic and worker-safe: inputs arrive on the engine
  request (proxy ids, normalized prior weights, relationship strength, and the
  short-overlap return series the request builder aligned), outputs are a new
  covariance row/column per assumed asset plus diagnostics."

(defn augment-risk-result-with-proxy-assumptions
  "Synthesizes a covariance row/column for every complete proxy assumption on top
  of the (already conservative-augmented) base risk result. Assets already
  present keep their position with the row replaced; re-admitted assets are
  appended. Assets are processed in sorted-id order so runs are deterministic;
  the matrix is symmetric by construction and PSD-repaired once at the end.
  Diagnostics land under [:risk-estimation :history-assumptions instrument-id],
  which the engine payload already forwards to results.

  `proxy-inputs-by-id` maps instrument-id -> flattened engine entry (see
  history-assumptions/proxy-engine-inputs). Entries lacking a positive
  volatility or any proxies are ignored."
