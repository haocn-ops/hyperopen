  "Read model for the portfolio Monte Carlo tab.

  Turns the cheap inputs assembled by `portfolio-vm` (the strategy's realized
  cumulative-return rows, a source version for cache-keying, the live total
  equity, and the selected scope/time-range) plus the user's controls into a
  render-ready model. The expensive `engine/run` call is cached by an input
  signature so it does not recompute on every live-data re-render; it only runs
  when the tab is actually rendered (the tab's `:render` closure is the only
  caller) and when an input that affects the numbers changes.

  The engine runs in unit-equity space (start-equity = 1), so the live account
  equity does not invalidate the cache — the view multiplies by `:live-equity`
  only where dollar amounts are shown."
