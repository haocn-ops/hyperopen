  "Amend one WORKING order from a settled execution run: reprice the resting limit
  (a new bps offset from the LIVE mark, or post-only at the touch) or convert it to a
  market order that crosses immediately for the REMAINING size.

  The client has no Hyperliquid `modify` implementation; the amend primitive is
  cancel + resubmit through the existing execute effect, whose cancel-first /
  halt-on-failure contract guarantees the replacement can never be live at the same
  time as the original. The amend plan is a derived plan (the Resume/Revert pattern):
  the latest ledger's rows with ONLY the target row re-armed — every sibling passes
  through verbatim (`attempt-row` leaves non-:ready rows untouched), so still-resting
  siblings keep their oids/responses, stay reconciled by the live overlay, and re-merge
  idempotently into the resting carryover."
