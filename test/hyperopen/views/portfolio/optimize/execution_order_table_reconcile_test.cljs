  "Reconciliation coverage for the order list across a Resume.

  Resume demotes every already-live row to :skipped (:already-resting / :already-filled),
  so a list filtered to WORKING empties out and the body swaps its <table> for an
  empty-state <p>. Replicant walks children positionally: a tag swap it cannot reuse
  desyncs the walk from the old vdom, and the keyed skipped <details> then lines up
  against the nil left by the (post-run, always nil) auto-exit strip. Reconciling a keyed
  child against a nil calls remove-child with a nil vdom node, which reads (aget nil 9)
  and throws.

  A throw inside replicant.dom/render leaves :rendering? true forever, so every later
  render only queues — the whole surface freezes, toasts included. These tests render the
  real view functions through Replicant's DOM-free mutation-log renderer."
