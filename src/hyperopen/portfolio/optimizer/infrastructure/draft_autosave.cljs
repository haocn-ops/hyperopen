(ns hyperopen.portfolio.optimizer.infrastructure.draft-autosave
  "Store watchers for the optimizer's opinionated default path.

  Autosave: every draft change persists (debounced) to the per-wallet
  `draft::<address>` IndexedDB record, so edits — including a deliberately cleared
  universe — survive reloads and wallet switches. The write is skipped for
  untouched/default drafts, when the effective address changed between the edit
  and the flush (a wallet switch must never cross-key a draft), and when the draft
  equals the value already persisted (a fresh restore does not re-write itself).

  Holdings arrival: on a cold page-load the /optimize/new route event fires before
  the account feed delivers any holdings, so the route-time preseed no-ops. This
  watcher observes the no-holdings -> holdings transition and re-dispatches the
  restore-or-preseed funnel (IndexedDB still wins over the machine preseed)."
