  "Read model for the vault detail Monte Carlo tab.

  Mirrors the portfolio Monte Carlo read model: it turns the vault's realized
  cumulative-return rows (the same series that powers the vault performance
  tearsheet, assembled by `chart-section` as the strategy benchmark-context)
  plus the user's controls into a render-ready model. The expensive
  `engine/run` is cached by an input signature so live TVL/equity ticks do not
  recompute it; the engine runs in unit-equity space (start-equity = 1) and the
  view scales to vault TVL only where dollar amounts are shown.

  Realized-return derivation and the engine are reused unchanged from the
  portfolio surface; only the surface chrome, the dollar base (vault TVL), and
  the method-tag window differ. Unlike the portfolio tab, the vault MC tab has no
  range control of its own (the chart range selector lives in the hidden
  performance-metrics card), so `chart-section` always feeds it the vault's
  all-time realized history to maximize bootstrap samples."
