  "Execution surface — where a solved rebalance is staged for review and commit. The
  standalone Rebalance preview tab was retired; \"Rebalance\" CTAs open this tab directly.
  A dense, phase-aware order list (staged → armed → running → done | halted | partial | resting) with
  a Buys/Sells flow summary, a per-order type editor and an Execution-health diagnostics rail.

  This namespace holds the header, phase control bands, the KPI strip, the health rail,
  and the latest-attempt panel. The order table + per-order editor live in the sibling
  namespace hyperopen.views.portfolio.optimize.execution-order-table; the staged-phase
  execution-strategy selector + high-cost warning live in
  hyperopen.views.portfolio.optimize.execution-strategy-band; pure presentation helpers
  shared by all live in hyperopen.views.portfolio.optimize.execution-shared.

  Honesty: each ready row is submitted with its selected order type (Market/Limit/TWAP/
  Passive maker), and the displayed type is the routed type — see execution-order-type."
