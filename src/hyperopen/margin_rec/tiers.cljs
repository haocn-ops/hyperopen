(ns hyperopen.margin-rec.tiers
  "Maintenance-margin model for isolated positions.

  Hyperliquid maintenance margin is piecewise-linear in notional: within a
  tier, mm(N) = rate*N - deduction, where the deduction keeps the curve
  continuous across tier boundaries. Tier tables arrive on perp meta
  (`marginTables`) and are resolved per asset at [:asset-contexts <coin>
  :margin]; assets without a resolved table fall back to the flat rate
  1/(2*maxLeverage). The exchange's own liquidationPx is treated as ground
  truth for the current position and used to calibrate a flat rate when the
  configured model disagrees with it.")
