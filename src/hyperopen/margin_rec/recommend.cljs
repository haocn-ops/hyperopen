  "Isolated-margin recommendation pipeline.

  Objective: the smallest isolated equity E such that the modeled probability
  of liquidation before the user's next likely intervention stays below the
  selected risk limit alpha, plus explicitly named buffers (funding, exit,
  model uncertainty). The adverse-path core comes from
  hyperopen.margin-rec.paths; the maintenance model from
  hyperopen.margin-rec.tiers; the horizon from hyperopen.margin-rec.episodes.

  Every product-policy constant lives here, named, so the recommendation's
  composition is auditable: nothing is an unlabeled safety factor.

  The pipeline is split so a driver can run it in idle-scheduled batches:
  `prepare` builds an immutable simulation context, `simulate-batch` (from
  paths) produces required-equity slices, `finalize` turns the sorted
  distribution into the recommendation. `recommend-sync` composes all three
  for tests and non-chunked callers."
