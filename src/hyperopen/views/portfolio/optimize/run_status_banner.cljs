  "Layer 1 of the run-feedback pattern: a full-width, sticky status banner that
  makes an in-flight optimization the page's primary state. It pins to the top of
  the scroll viewport (see .optimizer-run-banner in setup.css) so the user always
  sees that a run started, which step it is on, and how long it has taken —
  independent of scroll position, objective type, or whether the right rail has
  been pushed below the fold. The right-rail progress/readiness panels remain as
  Layer 2 detail; the Run button is Layer 3 (local action state). The redundancy
  is intentional: primary state must be visible where the user is looking.
