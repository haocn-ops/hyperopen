(ns hyperopen.portfolio.optimizer.application.engine.equal-risk-solve
  "Deterministic sequential solver for the :equal-risk objective.

  Each of the deterministic initializers (domain.equal-risk/seed-kinds) is
  projected onto the FULL feasible region by a `min ||y - seed||^2` QP, then
  refined by sequential quadratic programming: at iterate w solve the convex
  QP `min 0.5 y'By + (g - Bw)'y` over the gross equality + bounds + turnover
  region, Armijo-backtrack along the (always feasible, by convexity) segment
  toward the QP solution, and update B with a damped BFGS step. The best
  feasible final iterate across initializers wins; classification of the
  realized contribution error is truthful (:exact / :approximate /
  :not-converged) and computed by the payload from the PUBLISHED weights.

  Every subproblem goes through the injected `solve-problem` (the existing
  quadprog/OSQP adapter). quadprog returns plain maps, OSQP returns Promises;
  `chain` below threads both, so the synchronous engine path stays
  synchronous and the worker path becomes a single Promise. All numeric
  tolerances live in domain.equal-risk/tolerances."
