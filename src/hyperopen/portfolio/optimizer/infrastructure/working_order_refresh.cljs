(ns hyperopen.portfolio.optimizer.infrastructure.working-order-refresh
  "Keeps the open-orders view fresh while an execution run has WORKING orders.

  None of the streaming feeds cover named-dex (HIP-3) open orders — the websocket
  `openOrders` channel is default-dex only, webData2 is main-dex only, and the
  per-dex `frontendOpenOrders` snapshots are fetched only when explicitly
  refreshed. So once a run leaves a passive order resting on a named dex, the
  merged book never sees it (the row can't be amended) and never sees it LEAVE
  (a cancel elsewhere, or partial-fill corroboration, can't reconcile). This
  watcher polls the same surface refresh the staging flow uses, only while there
  is something working to watch.

  The store-watch gate must stay CHEAP (it runs on every mutation, and market
  data ticks constantly), so it reads only the frozen ledger — whose rows stay
  :resting forever by design (the ledger is the audit record; live status is a
  render-time reconcile). The reconcile therefore runs inside the slow interval
  tick, which self-stops the first time no row is still working."
