  page: the sizing-fidelity card rows (each asset's |weight| × σ against the
  shared equal ideal, with the rows a constraint moved off the 1/σ seed
  flagged), the KPI sizing-deviation tile, and the recommendation verdict
  copy. Pure functions over the solved result payload's :inverse-volatility
  section; every view branch for this objective reads from here so the page
  can never disagree with itself (same contract as equal-risk-results).

  The CONTRIBUTIONS tab model shapes the diagnostic :risk-contributions
  section the engine now emits for covariance-only runs generally: signed
  Euler shares over the published weights, with NO target framing — this
  objective sizes by standalone volatility and does not target contributions,
  so the rows deliberately drop the uniform-target fields the shared
  row-builder carries along."
