  "The WHAT CHANGES IF YOU EXECUTE strip: the Equal Risk results page's lead
  answer to 'what are the implications of this allocation?' — up to three
  current → target facts rendered with the why-card's icon fact cards,
  directly above the risk-contribution card:

    1. Risk imbalance (RMS gap to the equal target) — deep-links to the
       Risk Balance tab.
    2. Modeled total volatility — deep-links to the Diversification tab when
       the result carries the :risk-structure section that tab needs.
    3. Modeled one-year outcome (median ending wealth + touch-−50% odds) —
       no tab to point at; respects the leverage panel's gross/vol gate, so
       the strip never claims an outcome story the page below doesn't tell.

  Deep links are <label>s targeting the risk card's DOM-state tab radios
  (the zero-app-state idiom the why-card's correlation card established).
  Every number is read from models other cards already render — balance-model,
  the :risk-structure diversification summaries, and the leverage-risk model —
  so the strip can never disagree with the page. Renders nil for
  non-equal-risk results and when fewer than two chips have data: a one-chip
  strip is noise, not a summary."
