  "Pure refinement policy: how a user-requested refinement depth maps to a frontier
  point budget, how a solved result is graded into a quality/stability tier, and how a
  refined result compares against the draft it replaced.

  Refinement is a re-run of the existing solver at a higher frontier density (the engine
  maps over a pre-built problem vector; it is not a resumable/adaptive runner). Selection
  for minimum-variance / target-return (and any closed-form-eligible objective) is solved
  exactly and is independent of frontier density, so refinement only sharpens the chart in
  those cases; only a constrained max-sharpe / target-volatility selection is picked from
  the grid and can move when refined."
