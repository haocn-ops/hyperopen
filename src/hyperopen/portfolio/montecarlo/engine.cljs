  "Pure, deterministic Monte Carlo engine for the portfolio forecast surface.

  Two methods share one result shape, selected by `:method`:

    :shuffle   — the faithful QuantStats method (`quantstats/_montecarlo.py`).
                 Each simulation is a random *reordering* (permutation, no
                 replacement) of the realized returns, so the simulation length
                 equals the history length and there is no forecast horizon.
                 Reordering cannot change the product of (1+r), so every path
                 ends at the *same* realized terminal value; only the path —
                 hence the drawdown — varies. Sim 0 is the original order,
                 matching QuantStats's unshuffled first column.

    :bootstrap — draws the realized returns at random *with replacement* over a
                 forecast horizon, thousands of times, to map the range of
                 forward outcomes the same return distribution could produce.
                 The horizon is clamped to the sample size so a forecast can
                 never compound more days than were actually observed.

  Both preserve the empirical return distribution while breaking time-ordering,
  isolating luck from skill across drawdowns, Sharpe, and terminal value.

  Determinism: randomness comes from a seeded `mulberry32` generator, so a given
  set of inputs always produces the same result. The namespace performs no I/O
  and touches no DOM, so it is worker-safe and unit-testable. The hot simulation
  loop uses `js/Float64Array` and array access for speed; only the small,
  capped set of drawn paths and the per-grid percentile bands are materialized
  as ClojureScript vectors for the view layer.")
