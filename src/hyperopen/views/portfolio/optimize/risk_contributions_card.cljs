(ns hyperopen.views.portfolio.optimize.risk-contributions-card
  "Equal Risk results centerpiece: the RISK CONTRIBUTION BALANCE card — a
  horizontal diverging chart of each position's SIGNED Euler share of
  portfolio volatility against the equal 1/n target, built to the designer's
  2026-07-11 spec. One row per asset: recommended share as the sign-colored
  bar (colored by contribution SIGN, never by position side) capped with a
  green recommended dot, the current share as a gray outlined circle joined
  to the bar end by a dashed connector, and two mode-dependent right columns:
  purple Target / sign-colored Deviation while the fit is imperfect
  (:deviation display mode), or gray Current / neutral Shift once an :exact
  fit makes deviations dead zeros and the rebalance story is what's left
  (:shift mode — see balance-model). A per-row target tick draws only when a
  per-instrument target differs from the uniform equal target; otherwise the
  continuous dashed line IS the target. The axis always includes zero: a
  negative share means the position HEDGES the book, and positive shares can
  exceed 100% when another is negative — the signed shares still sum to 100%.
  No pies, donuts, stacked bars, or absolute contributions: those forms all
  lie once a contribution is negative.

  A five-cell KPI strip (risk-balance-kpi-strip, split for the namespace-size
  cap) sits between the header and the plot; the header's right side
  is a tab switcher (RISK CONTRIBUTION / BREAKDOWN / CORRELATION /
  RISK / RETURN) whose state lives entirely in the DOM as visually-hidden
  radio inputs toggled by scoped :has() CSS — no app state, same zero-state
  constraint the old <details> disclosure satisfied. The BREAKDOWN and
  CORRELATION tabs (designer specs 2026-07-11: correlation view + per-asset
  breakdown) render only when the result carries the :risk-structure payload
  section, so persisted pre-structure results keep the original pair; their
  panel bodies live in risk-asset-breakdown-panel (which defaults to one
  asset's decomposition and toggles to the all-assets chart) and
  risk-correlation-panel (the full-width P&L/underlying heatmap). Which asset
  the breakdown tab explains IS app state (Allocation-row clicks and the
  panel's Change-asset select both set it) — that selection routes data
  across cards, which DOM-state radios cannot.

  Rows come pre-ordered and capped from the equal-risk-results view-model
  (mode-dependent: worst deviations / signed-share order in :deviation mode,
  biggest shifts / current-share order in :shift mode, honest remainder line
  either way); the lanes are plain HTML so the zero/target lines
  stay 1px and markers stay round at any width. Replaces the
  efficient-frontier chart for :equal-risk — that objective is not selected
  from a frontier and must not be plotted as if it were."
