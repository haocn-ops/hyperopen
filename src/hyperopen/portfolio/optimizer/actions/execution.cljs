  The entry gates on currency, not merely `solved?`: a stale recommendation (inputs edited

  trader sees what WOULD trade but can't arm or commit until the optimizer is re-run. A
  read-only (spectate) block takes precedence — it is the harder restriction and its message
  wins.

  `exit-instrument-ids` (a set, usually the modal's) are the trader's per-staging
  \"sell this held-out asset to zero\" marks: when the set is PROVIDED (even empty —
  the toggle-off path must return the plan to the run's own preview) the preview is
  re-derived from the STORED run request (the source the stored preview was built
  from, cost contexts included) with those instruments treated as explicit exits —
  never from the live draft, whose divergence is the stale gate's concern, and never
  by mutating the request, so the input-signature stays untouched."
