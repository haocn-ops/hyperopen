  "Pure policy + constants for per-asset history assumptions.

  Some selected optimizer assets have little or no return history. The engine
  cannot estimate covariance for them from realized series, so it drops them and
  the run is blocked. A history assumption lets the user supply a stand-in risk
  treatment for such an asset:

    :conservative - no diversification credit. Use the user's volatility and a
                    correlation floor against the rest of the universe, capped to
                    a small max weight. Engine-backed via
                    `risk/augment-risk-result-with-assumptions`.
    :proxy        - model the asset as a basket of user-selected proxy assets
                    that DO have usable history. The qualitative prior (the
                    selected basket) chooses the exposure; a regularized
                    regression on the asset's short overlap adjusts it;
                    confidence governs the shrinkage between the two; specific
                    risk and a tight cap keep the optimizer honest. Engine-backed
                    via `history-assumption-proxy/augment-risk-result-with-proxy-assumptions`.

  (An earlier :proxy mode - a single related asset at a chosen relationship
  strength - was removed because it was collected but never engine-backed. Its
  persisted entries are still migrated to conservative on load; the migration
  keys on the legacy singular :proxy-instrument-id shape, so the new multi-proxy
  shape passes through. See contracts.migrations.)

  This namespace is the ONE source of truth for the numeric presets so the engine,
  request-builder, readiness, defaults, and view models never disagree. All
  magnitudes are decimals (5% => 0.05)."
