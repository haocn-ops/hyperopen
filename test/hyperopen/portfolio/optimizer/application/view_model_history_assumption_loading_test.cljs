  "Loading-visibility coverage for the proxy workflow cards (own namespace:
  view-model-history-assumption-cards-test sits at its size cap, 2026-07-07).

  While proxy history is still fetching, the card must say so instead of
  passing mid-flight \"no data\" verdicts off as final — and once the load
  settles, an unusable proxy must never keep claiming \"loading\"."
