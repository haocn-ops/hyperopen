  "Pure action handlers for the 2D exposure-map Positioning control. Each handler reads the
  current draft constraints, asks the pure `exposure-policy` namespace for the next FULL
  constraint map, and persists it whole via `common/save-draft-path-values` (one save-many that
  also flips the dirty flag). Writing the whole map is deliberate: a zero gross band must DISSOC
  :gross-min, and the save-many effect can only assoc path values, so per-key writes could not
  clear the floor.

  These handlers only ever write the existing canonical constraint keys
  (:gross-min/:gross-max/:net-min/:net-max/:max-asset-weight), so the request builder and specs
  are unchanged."
