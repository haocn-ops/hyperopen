(ns hyperopen.portfolio.optimizer.application.engine.inverse-volatility-payload
  "The :inverse-volatility result-payload section: per-asset sizing rows that
  let the results card PROVE the objective's promise (|weight| * sigma equal
  across every asset the projection left free), plus the ideal pre-projection
  seed and the realized deviation from parity.

  A row is :moved-off-seed? when the projection pinned it to one of its
  encoded bounds AND its weight materially differs from the ideal seed — the
  honest 'a cap/lock/side limit moved this row' flag. A FREE row whose |w|·σ
  still deviates from the free-set parity is :turnover-limited? — only the
  turnover L1 budget can displace an unpinned row, since at the KKT optimum
  the sigma-weighted projection otherwise re-equalizes free rows exactly.

  Alongside the sizing section, solved runs also publish the objective-
  agnostic :risk-contributions / :current-risk-contributions /
  :risk-structure analytics (engine.risk-analytics-payload — the same pure
  weights+covariance sections Equal Risk emits). The contribution summary's
  targets are the uniform 1/n vector only because the summary math requires
  one; this objective does not target contributions, so the section carries
  :quality :diagnostic instead of a convergence quality. When the analytics
  inputs are unaligned or degenerate the diagnostics are simply omitted — the
  sizing section is the objective's primary proof and never depends on them."
