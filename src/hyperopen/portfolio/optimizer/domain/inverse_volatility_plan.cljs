(ns hyperopen.portfolio.optimizer.domain.inverse-volatility-plan
  "Solver plan for the Risk-weighted sizing (:inverse-volatility) objective.

  The user has already fixed every directional decision (assets, sides, gross
  target G); this objective sizes each asset by its own volatility only:
  |w_i| proportional to 1/sigma_i, scaled so the book magnitudes sum to G,
  correlations deliberately ignored. That ideal seed is then made feasible by
  ONE sigma-weighted projection QP over the same convex region Equal Risk
  uses (signed-gross equality, per-asset bounds and locks, turnover L1):

      minimize 0.5 * (w - seed)' * diag(sigma) * (w - seed)

  The sigma weighting is what makes cap handling honest: at the KKT optimum
  every asset NOT pinned to a bound satisfies |w_i| * sigma_i = constant, so
  excess from a capped asset re-equalizes risk-weight parity among the free
  assets (water-filling) instead of shifting weights uniformly. When nothing
  binds, the QP returns the seed itself.

  Feasibility screening reuses domain.equal-risk-presolve verbatim (fixed
  sides, gross sanity, aggregate capacity, covariance validity) with messages
  naming this objective. Gross floor/ceiling rows are deliberately absent
  from the QP: presolve rejects any target outside [floor, ceiling] and the
  signed-gross EQUALITY then pins realized gross exactly, so the rows would
  be redundant. Expected returns are never consumed."
