  "Pure export/import model for the proxy workflow's file channel: the user
  downloads a template listing every asset that needs a history assumption, a
  desktop AI agent fills in proxy baskets / conservative choices offline, and
  the completed file is imported to author those assumptions in bulk.

  Honesty invariants, inherited from the return-views IO precedent:
  - unconfigured assets export `approach: null` and import skips null
    approaches, so an unedited round-trip is a no-op;
  - already-configured assets export their current setup and a rebuilt entry
    equal to the existing one (modulo provenance metadata) counts as
    unchanged;
  - import never removes an assumption — forgetting stays the card's explicit
    Clear gesture.

  No DOM and no clock live here; callers supply `now-ms`."

  ["# What this file is"
   "This is an assumptions template exported from a mean-variance portfolio optimizer (daily returns) trading crypto instruments — perps, spot, and vaults — on Hyperliquid. Each entry under `assets` is in the user's portfolio universe but has too little native price history to estimate risk from data (`native-days` = its daily return observations; under ~360 is flagged, under 30 the optimizer blocks the run). Until an asset gets an assumption it is EXCLUDED from the optimized portfolio."
   "Your task: for each asset in `assets`, EITHER select a proxy basket (`approach: \"proxy\"`) OR mark it conservative (`approach: \"conservative\"`), filling the fields in place in this JSON. The user imports the completed file back into the app."
   "`export-scope` says what `assets` covers: \"proxy-workflow\" lists only the assets already flagged for assumptions; \"universe\" lists every included portfolio asset so you can also flag ones YOU judge statistically untrustworthy. Leave `approach` null for any asset that should keep using its own history."
   "Where proxies come from: propose them from your own market knowledge — liquid, long-established assets listed on Hyperliquid (majors like BTC, ETH, SOL, or sector peers you know are listed there as perps). There is no menu to pick from: the app validates every proxy on import, drops any symbol it doesn't recognize or whose history is too short, tells the user what was dropped, and renormalizes the basket over what survives. In a \"universe\" export, the `assets` list itself shows the user's whole portfolio with a `history-status` per asset — prefer proxies from its \"verified\" entries (at least `history-policy.minimum-history-days` of usable daily history), since those are guaranteed to resolve. Use outside research only to understand what each token IS (ecosystem, sector, value accrual); every row carries its full `name` and market `kind` to help."
   "# How your answers are used"
   "- A proxy basket is a co-movement model, not a lookalike list. The optimizer builds the asset's covariance row from the weighted returns of the basket. Pick assets whose DAILY RETURNS should move with the target — shared ecosystem, sector, risk drivers, volatility tier. Narrative or price similarity is irrelevant, and correlation over a short window alone is not evidence."
   "- Your weights are a prior that starts out as the whole model. The optimizer ridge-regresses the target's short history against the basket (once max(10, k+3) overlapping days exist; k = basket size) and blends it in with weight q ~= (n/(n+120)) * min(1, R^2/0.5). With 12 days of overlap q <= 9%, so your prior is ~91% of the model. Set weights as economic exposure loadings you would defend being used as-is — never as correlation or R^2 scores. Omit all weights for equal weight; weights must be >= 0 and are normalized to sum to 1."
   "- `relationship-strength` caps how much of the asset's variance the basket may ever explain: at least 50% stays idiosyncratic for \"low\", 25% for \"medium\", 15% for \"high\". \"high\" = near-mechanical link (wrapper or derivative of the same underlying); \"medium\" = solid same-sector peers; \"low\" = loose or anchors-only."
   "- `approach: \"conservative\"` models the asset at ~80% annualized volatility with a 0.75 correlation floor to everything and a ~3% allocation cap — it almost always yields a tiny or zero allocation. It is the honest choice when no defensible basket exists."
   "- After import the app re-validates every pick: a member whose history proves unusable is dropped and the basket renormalizes over the rest; if none survive, the asset stays excluded."
   "# Choosing a basket"
   "- Build 2-4 members from different roles: a broad market anchor (BTC/ETH), a chain/ecosystem proxy (e.g. SOL for a Solana-ecosystem token), sector peers (DeFi, L2, AI, gaming, memecoin, exchange/revenue tokens), or a token-economics twin (similar fee/buyback/staking accrual). Diversified beats near-identical; a single proxy imports one asset's idiosyncratic shocks wholesale and is only right for mechanical relationships."
   "- Include an anchor when useful, but never let anchors substitute for real sector peers. If only anchors fit, the basket is crude: set relationship-strength \"low\" and say so in `rationale`."
   "- Never pick a stablecoin or cash-like asset unless the target is one. Prefer long-established, liquid assets (`history-policy.preferred-history-days` or more of trading history is ideal). Never use a recently-listed or short-history asset as a proxy — it cannot anchor another and will be dropped on import."
   "- If you cannot name at least 2 defensible proxies, choose \"conservative\". That is a correct answer, not a failure."
   "# Fields to fill, per asset"
   "- `approach`: \"proxy\" or \"conservative\". Leave null to skip — the asset stays excluded."
   "- `proxies` (proxy only): 1-4 entries like {\"symbol\": \"SOL\", \"weight\": 0.5} naming Hyperliquid-listed assets (an exact `instrument-id` such as \"perp:SOL\" is also accepted and safest). Symbols the app can't resolve are skipped on import and reported."
   "- `relationship-strength` (proxy only): \"low\" | \"medium\" | \"high\" (default \"medium\")."
   "- `expected-return-percent`: annualized, in percent (e.g. 12.5). Check `optimization-objective` and `objective-uses-returns` — minimum-variance ignores returns entirely; leave null unless the objective uses returns and you hold a real view (default 0 = no edge)."
   "- `rationale`: 1-3 sentences the user will read: why this basket (or why conservative), plus any notable rejection — e.g. a perfect sector match skipped for short history."
