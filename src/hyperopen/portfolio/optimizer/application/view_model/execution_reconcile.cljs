  "Read-only overlay that reconciles a frozen execution-ledger row (status :resting, captured
  ONCE at submission and never re-derived) against the LIVE order/fill feeds the trading screen
  uses, so a passive limit order that fills on the book stops showing as \"open\".

  Why this is needed: the optimizer execution ledger is an audit snapshot — a resting row records
  {:status :resting :response …} at submission and is sealed into the execution history
  (contracts/execution-history-path). Nothing re-reads exchange state against it, so the row reads
  :resting forever. The trading screen never has this problem because it recomputes order status
  from the live feeds on every render. This overlay gives the Execution tab the same
  derive-live-on-render behaviour, scoped to the ledger's own oids, WITHOUT mutating the persisted
  (audit) ledger.

  Linkage: a resting row carries its exchange oid at [:response :data :statuses 0 :resting :oid]
  (execution/resting-oid); the live feeds key on the same oid:
  - [:orders :fills]       — own-account trade fills (userFills); a fill for the oid is positive
                             evidence the order executed, and carries the realized price/size.
  - [:orders :open-orders] — own-account resting orders (openOrders); an oid still present means
                             the order is still (at least partly) live on the book.

  Decision (conservative — never assert a fill without evidence, so spectate / vault-target /
  not-yet-subscribed all degrade safely to the current :resting display):
  - oid still on the book      => stay :resting (stamp realized partial if it also has fills)
  - oid has fills + off-book    => :submitted (filled) + realized px/size
  - otherwise (no fills)        => row unchanged (:resting), exactly as today."
